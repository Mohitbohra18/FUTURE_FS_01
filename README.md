# Mohit – Voice OS Developer Portfolio

A visually rich, interactive React portfolio for **Mohit** (Voice OS Developer | AI Enthusiast | BTech CSE), built with:

- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- Lucide React
- Recharts

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL in your browser (by default `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- Dark/light mode is handled purely in React state (no localStorage).
- Update links like GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode, and resume URL in `src/App.jsx` to your real profiles and file paths.
